# C02_app Proof of Concept

This repository contains a minimal proof-of-concept for a CO₂ monitoring
application written in Python.

The `co2_app` package simulates reading CO₂ levels and stores them in a CSV
file. Use the `main` module to run the monitor.

```bash
python -m co2_app.main
```

## Running Tests

Run the unit tests with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
